## Face Camera X

Face camera is a module for cameras with face and location detection using supporting modules, including:

- **[CameraX](https://developer.android.com/training/camerax)**: CameraX is a Jetpack library, built to make developing camera apps easy.
- **[ML Kit](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit)**: ML Kitâ€™s processing happens on-device. This makes it fast and unlocks real-time use cases like processing of camera input. It also works while offline and can be used for processing images that need to remain on the device.
- **[Location](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/setup)**: To get the location of a specific coordinate from maps
- **[Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation)**: Navigation is an interaction that allows users to browse, enter, and exit various content within an application.
- **[Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/lifecycle)**: Lifecycle-based components perform actions in response to changes in the lifecycle state of other components, such as activities and fragments.
- **[Compressor](https://github.com/zetbaitsu/Compressor)**: Compressor is a lightweight and powerful android image compression library.
- **[Dexter](https://github.com/Karumi/Dexter)**: Dexter is an Android library that simplifies the process of requesting permissions at runtime.

# Usage


1. Gradle dependency:

	```groovy
	allprojects {
	   repositories {
           	maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
	   }
	}
	```

    ```groovy
   implementation 'com.github.mnaufalhamdani:facecamerax:1.0.4'
    ```

2. The ImagePicker configuration is created using the builder pattern.

	**Kotlin**

	```kotlin
    FaceCameraX.with(this)
    	.customPath("YOUR_PATH")					//Custom path photo
            .compress(80)							//Default compress is 80
            .coordinat(0.0, 0.0)		                          	//Default coordinat is 0.0
            .defaultCamera(FaceCameraX.LensCamera.LENS_BACK_CAMERA)      	//Default camera is Front Camera
            .isFaceDetection(true)                                        	//Default is true
            .isWaterMark(true)                                            	//Default is true
            .start()  
    ```
    
3. Handling results

    **Override `onActivityResult` method and handle ImagePicker result.**

    ```kotlin
    override fun onActivityResult(requestCode: Int, resultCode: Int, data: Intent?) {
         if (requestCode == 0) {
            if (resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK) {
                data?.let {
                    it.data?.let { uri ->
                        val path = uri.toFile().absolutePath
                        binding.tvPath.text = path
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)
    }
    ```
